Watchdog
==

Watchdog is a method used for classifying and moderating content in order to encourage a safe, virtual society.
Our watchdog aims to prevent nsfw content in younger-age social networks
This module currently compiles with Python 2.7.6
While WatchDog is under construction, it can still be used with your favorite python interpreter. The python files can be referenced and accessed through the command line or another process. The provided test scripts also can be run to see example output.

Note for csce470 Checkpoint #3
Simply run the 'content-watchdog.py' script. The main method in that file creates an instance of the classifier and uses it to run analysis on sample content
