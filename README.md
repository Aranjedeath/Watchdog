Watchdog
==

Watchdog is a method used for classifying and moderating content in a safe virtual society.
Our watchdog prevents nsfw content in younger-age social networks.

This module currently contains implementations in Python and Objective-C

The python files can be referenced and accessed through the command line or another manual process. The provided test scripts also can be run to see example output.

The Objective-C static library is still under construction, but the two files (.m and .h) can be copied into your project's directory to be referenced.

Note for csce470 checkpoints
Simply run the 'content-watchdog.py' script. The main method in that file creates an instance of the classifier and uses it to run analysis on sample content
