Watchdog
========

A classification method for recognizing inappropriate content in the midst of a virtual society

This module compiles with Python 2.7.6

While WatchDog is under construction, it can still be used with your favorite python interpreter!

The python files can be copied into your directory or you can simply run certain scripts that are set up with test code

======
CSCE470 Deliv: run the 'content-watchdog.py' script. The main method in that file creates an instance of the classifier and uses it to run analysis on sample content
